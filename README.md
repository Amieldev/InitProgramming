            The history of modern day computers mainly began during WW2 in the manhattan project.<br>
            During the development of the <b>Atmoic Bomb</b> there where 3 machines that calculate arithmetic operations separately (+,- & ).

            This made people realise that there was the need for the invention<br>
            for a more powerful machine that can compute stuff at very high speeds.<br>
            The way computers parse and run code is extremely similar to the process of book publication.<br>
