# History of Computers

>>The history of modern day computers mainly began during WW2 in the manhattan project.
>>During the development of the Atmoic Bomb there where 3 machines that calculate arithmetic operations separately (+,- & ).
>>A group of female hakcers known as the computers did all the calculations during WW2
            This turned out to be extremely inefficient at solving computationaly expensive tasks.


>>This made people realise that there was the need for the invention
>>for a more powerful machine that can compute stuff at very high speeds.
>>The way computers parse and run code is extremely similar to the process of book publication.

# Steganography

>>Is the process of hidig data inside of files
>>Steganography uses some concepts from cryptography.
